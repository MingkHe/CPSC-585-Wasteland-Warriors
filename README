Milestone #2

For this milestone we have implemented each of the subsystems in our game. Our goal was to get each system to comunicate within in
our framework. The input system is capturing input from the keyboard and controller. The audio system is able to start/stop and
pause/play music files. The physics system is modelling collisions for ojects and to ground plane. The physics engine is also
handling the movement of the car on the ground plane. The rendering system is handeling the lighting and shading of all the objects
in the scene.
