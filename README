We used the biolerplate code from our CPSC 453 as our basic render controller. The code just simple render a triangle on the screen.
We added all the necessary classes into our program but they are just stubbed implemented:

Added Classes:

Gamestate:
Gamestate

Subsystem:
UserInput
AI_Interaction
Physics_Controller
Audio_Controller

Entities:
Entity
Vehicle
PlayerUnit
EnemyUnit
MapTerrain
MapObstacle

The main game loop implementation is in the file Program.cpp line 51.

The full interaction and relationship among the classes listed above are explained in the Game Application Framework document.

For milestone 1, our game program is able to run the main game loop and render a triangle in the middle of the screen for each frame.
It can also receive the user input(just key WASD) from keyborad and print them out on the standard output.
