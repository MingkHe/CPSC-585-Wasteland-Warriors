# --Wasteland Warrior--
## Milestone #3

For this milestone, we have implemented the game rules, opponent driving AI, 3D rendering engine, audio engine and refine gameplay. Our goal was to connect each system together to create a first playable of our game.

### To Build and Run:
To build, download or clone the Wasteland Warrior files from https://github.com/MingkHe/CPSC-585-Wasteland-Warriors/tree/Wasteland_Warrior
then open the Wasteland Warrior solution file in Visual Studio 2017, found in the folder CPSC-585-Wasteland-Warriors\Wasteland_Warrior.
Then build and run the program.

be compiled using only the x86 Debug mode.
