## Milestone #2

For this milestone we have implemented each of the main subsystems in our game. Our goal was to get each main system to
comunicate within in our framework. The input system is capturing input from the keyboard and controller. The audio system 
is able to start/stop and pause/play music files. The physics system is modelling collisions for objects and the ground plane.
The physics engine is also handling the movement of the car on the ground plane. The rendering system is handleing the renering
of the red box and the ground plane.
