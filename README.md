# --Wasteland Warrior--
## Milestone #3

For this milestone, we have implemented the game rules, opponent driving AI, 3D rendering engine, audio engine and refine gameplay. Our goal was to connect each system together to create a first playable of our game.

### To Build and Run:
To build, download or clone the Wasteland Warrior files from https://github.com/MingkHe/CPSC-585-Wasteland-Warriors/tree/Wasteland_Warrior
then open the Wasteland Warrior solution file in Visual Studio 2017, found in the folder CPSC-585-Wasteland-Warriors\Wasteland_Warrior.
Then build and run the program.

Please note that you may need to change the Windows SDK version first depending on which version you are running. Also, the code needs to
be compiled using only the x86 Debug mode.
