### Gameplay:

    As the Wasteland Warrior your goal is to survive the apocolypse and escape to freedom. You will face 5
    waves of enemies who are trying to destroy your vehicle. Once you complete all the waves, the game will end.
    There are two ways to attack your enemies: You can either ram them until their vehicles are destroyed, or
    if you have amunition, you can shoot them. During each wave you will have different objectives. The wave will
    not end until all the objetives are completed.
